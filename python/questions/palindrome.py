# Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean
# representing whether the string is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and
# backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.
# it's written the same forward and backward
# Start by building the input string in reverse order and comparing this newly built string to the input string. Can you do this without using string concatenations?
# Can you optimize your algorithm by using recursion? What are the implications of recursion on an algorithm's space-time complexity analysis?
# Go back to an iterative solution and try using pointers to solve this problem: start with a pointer at the first index of the string and a pointer at the final index of the string. What can you do from there?
